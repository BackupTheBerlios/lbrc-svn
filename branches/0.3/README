Preface
=======
This software is provided without any warranty. It should work ok, but
if it eats your computer, its not my problem.


Description
===========
A small programm allowing a Java 2 ME and bluetooth enabled device to control a
linux computer. It consists of a client part on the device and a server part on
the controlled computer.

The basic approach of injecting input events via the uinput Device in Linux
Kernel 2.6.x. This also means, that the user running LBRC will be required to
have write access to the device (currently assumed as /dev/input/uinput). This
approach was inspired by the WiiMote(??) Driver written in Python.

The J2ME Part does two things: Scan for an device, where our Service is running
and then just send keycodes from the device with additional info, wheter the
key was pressed or released.

The Server part receives these keycodes and according to a config file
(profiles.conf) maps these to keystrokes, mouse movement, mousewheel movement
or mousebutton clicks.


Install / Usage
===============
   0. make sure uinput device driver is available (module is called uinput),
      check that "uinputdevice" in "config.conf" points to your device entry for
      uinput (known locations: /dev/input/uinput or /dev/misc/uinput) and this
      device is writeable by you

   0a. if the uinput module is not available, you can enable it by recompiling
       your kernel you find the option unter  
       DeviceDrivers/InputDeviceSupport/MiscellaneousDrivers/User Level Driver Support

   1. install the LBRC.jad/LBRC.jar File in j2me/bin onto your phone

   2. run server/LBRC.py (it's adviced to run it on the console, at
      least the first time)

   3. Make your computer visible
      (at least mine is per default not visible)

   4. run BlueRemote on your phone, "Find Devices" and choose your PC

   5a. If you own a phone, that send the same codes as mine (Nokia 6230i), 
       you get mouse control on the steering cross, ... (see profiles.conf)

   5b. Else look at the computer screen, when pressing the keys on the phone an
       note down the shown codes. After that open profiles.conf and modify it
       according to the example given there

       After that I would ask you to create a file documenting your codes and
       send it to me
